Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing language models to access external knowledge to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. RAG systems address the limitations of purely generative models by grounding responses in retrieved factual information.

How RAG Works:
1. Query Processing: The user's question is processed and converted into a search query
2. Document Retrieval: Relevant documents are retrieved from a knowledge base using similarity search
3. Context Integration: Retrieved documents are combined with the original query
4. Response Generation: A language model generates a response based on the query and retrieved context
5. Answer Synthesis: The final answer incorporates information from both the model's training and retrieved documents

Key Components:
- Knowledge Base: A collection of documents or structured data
- Embedding Model: Converts text into vector representations for similarity search
- Vector Database: Stores and indexes document embeddings for efficient retrieval
- Retriever: Finds relevant documents based on query similarity
- Generator: Language model that produces responses using retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Access to up-to-date information beyond training data
- Improved factual accuracy and reduced hallucinations
- Ability to cite sources and provide transparency
- Flexibility to update knowledge without retraining the model
- Cost-effective compared to training larger models

Applications:
- Question-answering systems
- Customer support chatbots
- Research and knowledge management tools
- Educational platforms
- Technical documentation assistants

RAG System Types:
1. Dense Retrieval: Uses dense vector representations for semantic similarity
2. Sparse Retrieval: Uses traditional keyword-based search methods
3. Hybrid Retrieval: Combines both dense and sparse retrieval approaches
4. Multi-hop RAG: Performs multiple retrieval steps for complex queries
