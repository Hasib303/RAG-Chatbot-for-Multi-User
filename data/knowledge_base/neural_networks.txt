Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They are composed of interconnected nodes called neurons that process information through weighted connections and activation functions.

Basic Structure:
- Input Layer: Receives the input data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces the final result
- Weights and Biases: Parameters that determine the network's behavior

Types of Neural Networks:
1. Feedforward Neural Networks: Information flows in one direction from input to output
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Can process sequences of data with memory capabilities
4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

Key advantages of deep learning:
- Automatic feature extraction
- Can handle complex, non-linear relationships
- Scalable with large amounts of data
- State-of-the-art performance in many domains
