Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Training data: The dataset used to teach the algorithm
- Features: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena
- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: A technique to assess model performance and generalizability
