Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human text and speech.

Core NLP Tasks:
1. Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
2. Part-of-speech tagging: Identifying grammatical roles of words
3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities
4. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of text
5. Machine Translation: Converting text from one language to another
6. Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries of longer texts
7. Question Answering: Answering questions based on given text

Key NLP Techniques:
- Bag of Words: Representing text as word frequency vectors
- TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for text importance
- Word Embeddings: Dense vector representations of words (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Language Models: Statistical models that predict word sequences
- Transformers: Attention-based models that have revolutionized NLP

Modern NLP Applications:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Search engines and information retrieval
- Content recommendation systems
- Automated content generation
- Language translation services
- Social media monitoring and analysis
